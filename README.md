# Project-Report
Public Transport is one of the leading solutions taken up in the current scenario where all the leading countries are stressing upon Sustainable development. However, whenever we use Public Transport Service, we face an issue, due to the rush and the prolonged waiting time. Thus, promotes people to move towards use of private vehicles and leads to increase in pollution related problem. This project aims to address this issue, we intend to display the capacity and the Estimated arrival time of the buses on Screens provided at Bus Stop. This will help make commuters travel easier and hassle free.
